# Future Scope

## 🎯 Instant Segmentation

<div style="text-align: justify;">
We can implement targeted lesion segmentation. This approach involves identifying and segmenting the specific area where skin cancer or diseases are observed. By precisely isolating the affected regions, the system can provide more accurate and focused results, aiding in the early detection and treatment planning for skin cancer cases. Targeted lesion segmentation enhances the system's effectiveness and adaptability, ensuring that it can pinpoint and analyze areas of concern with precision.
</div>

## 🚀 Advanced Ensemble Techniques

<div style="text-align: justify;">
We want to extend the use of ensemble learning techniques. Currently, the project utilizes ensemble methods for model predictions. In the future, consider incorporating more advanced ensemble techniques such as stacking, boosting, or bagging. These methods can further enhance model accuracy and robustness by combining the strengths of multiple models. Advanced ensemble techniques can lead to even more reliable and accurate skin cancer detection. They can effectively handle complex cases and provide more confidence in the system's diagnostic results, making it a valuable tool for healthcare professionals.
</div>

## 🧠 Incorporating More Models

<div style="text-align: justify;">
We continuously expand the range of models used for skin cancer detection. We will include additional pre-trained models and experiment with custom architectures. We will consider incorporating models designed for specific skin cancer subtypes or skin conditions. A diverse set of models increases the system's ability to detect a wide variety of skin conditions accurately. It allows for better coverage of rare or less common skin cancers and ensures that the system remains up-to-date with the latest advancements in deep learning.
</div>

## 📊 Large Dataset Collection

<div style="text-align: justify;">
We will invest in collecting and curating a larger and more diverse dataset of skin images. We can collaborate with healthcare institutions, dermatologists, and research organizations to accumulate high-quality images representing various skin types, ages, and ethnicities. We will augment the dataset with expert annotations. A larger and diverse dataset is the foundation of robust machine learning models. It enables the system to generalize better and detect skin cancer accurately across a broader spectrum of cases. Moreover, it fosters the development of models that are more resilient to real-world variations in skin appearances.
